  DRP-flavored pipeline to support validation
  during commissioning, and will help inform
  what changes to make the following night. Detector and Visit
  level tasks can be run in real time by e.g. Rapid Analysis.
  The rest of the pipeline is expected to be run as part of the
  10am processing.

      Global tasks that can be run at end of night or multiple times during
      the night, to get a summary of observations taken.
  # The following N steps should be run once at the end of the night
  # Steps 2b,2c,2d,2e,4,5,6,7 are currently the same as DRP.
  # This step3 here does not make templates. To run step4,step5,step6 you must
  # provide a collection with templates as input, ideally the same one that
  # was used for prompt processing.
  # A complete pipeline without DIA is #step2b,step2c,step2d,step2e,step3,step7

      This overrides the default DRP pipeline by not making nightly templates.
      We may want to make daily templates in the future.

      Patch and Tract-level tasks that make coadds and object tables that
      can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2d'
      subsets.
