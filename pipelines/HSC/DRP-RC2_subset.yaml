subsets:
  fgcm:
    subset:
      - fgcmBuildFromIsolatedStars
      - fgcmFitCycle
      - fgcmOutputProducts
    description: |
      Subset that includes all FGCM tasks.
  simpleSingleFrame:
    subset:
      - isr
      - calibrateImage
    description: |
       A simplified single frame pipeline to make the quantum graph more readable.
  multiVisit:
    subset: []
    description: |
      The multiVisit subset defined in pipe_tasks' DRP.yaml is not safe to
      use on HSC for various reasons; use 'step1', 'step2', and 'step3' subsets
      instead.  It may be re-enabled in the future.
  singleFrame:
    subset:
      - isr
      - calibrateImage
      - transformPreSourceTable
      - consolidatePreSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - skyCorr
      - isolatedStarAssociation
    description: |
      Set of tasks for complete single frame processing. Because this includes
      skyCorr, it requires multiple detectors per visit. Although they duplicate
      tasks from the main "stepN" subsets from drp_pipe's DRP-RC2.yaml, we
      include the subsets singleFrame, source_calibration, coadd_measurement, and
      forced_objects within this pipeline so that users following the "getting
      started" tutorial on pipelines.lsst.io understand the basic steps that are
      contained within each subset.
  source_calibration:
    subset:
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - updateVisitSummary
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
      - writeRecalibratedSourceTable
      - transformSourceTable
      - consolidateSourceTable
  coadd_measurement:
    subset:
      - detection
      - mergeDetections
      - deblend
      - measure
      - mergeMeasurements
  forced_objects:
    subset:
      - forcedPhotCcd
      - forcedPhotCoadd
      - transformObjectTable
      - writeObjectTable
      - consolidateObjectTable
  nightlyStep1:
    subset:
      - isr
      - calibrateImage
      - transformPreSourceTable
    description: |
      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.
      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression if any later steps will also be run, because downstream steps
      require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch' constraints will always
      select partial visits that overlap that region.
  nightlyStep2a:
    subset:
      - consolidatePreSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - skyCorr
    description: |
      Per-visit tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1'.
      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression. skyCorr and FGCM require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch'
      constraints will always select partial visits that overlap that region.
      This includes FGCM because it's configured here to run in "global" mode,
      which means one should not use 'tract' expression to constrain it, and if
      one _did_ run it with a tract constraint (which would be a common
      occurrence if it was included in any later step), it would be fed the
      wrong (partial-visit) inputs to its 'background' connection.
      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.
  nightlyStep2b:
    subset:
      - isolatedStarAssociation
      - gbdesAstrometricFit
    description: |
      Per-tract tasks.
      gbdesAstrometricFit should be run with explicit 'tract' constraints
      essentially all the time, because otherwise quanta will be created for
      jobs with only partial visit coverage.
      isolatedStarAssociation can be run with or without 'tract' constraints.
  nightlyStep2c:
    subset:
      - fgcmBuildFromIsolatedStars
      - fgcmFitCycle
      - fgcmOutputProducts
    description: |
      FGCM tasks that must be run with no pipetask multiprocessing
      and no data query
  nightlyStep2d:
    subset:
      - makeVisitTable
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - updateVisitSummary
      - writeRecalibratedSourceTable
      - transformSourceTable
      - consolidateSourceTable
      - catalogMatchVisit
      - astrometricRefCatSourceVisit
    description: |
      Per-visit tasks. These should never be run with tract constraints
  nightlyStep3:
    subset:
      - makeDirectWarp
      - makePsfMatchedWarp
      - selectDeepCoaddVisits
      - assembleCoadd
      - detection
      - mergeDetections
      - deblend
      - measure
      - mergeMeasurements
      - forcedPhotCoadd
      - transformObjectTable
      - writeObjectTable
      - consolidateObjectTable
      - healSparsePropertyMaps
      - objectEpochTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets.
      These should be run with explicit 'tract' constraints essentially all the
      time, because otherwise quanta will be created for jobs with only partial
      visit coverage.
      It is expected that many forcedPhotCcd quanta will "normally" fail when
      running this subset, but this isn't a problem right now because there
      are no tasks downstream of it.  If other tasks regularly fail or we add
      tasks downstream of forcedPhotCcd, these subsets or the tasks will need
      additional changes.
      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.
  nightlyStep4:
    subset:
      - reprocessVisitImage
      - forcedPhotCcd
      - sourceObjectMatch
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2'
      and 'step3' subsets
      These detector and visit-level tasks should not be run with
      'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID expression if all
      reference catalogs or diffIm templates that cover these
      detector-level quanta are desired.
  nightlyStep8:
    subset:
      - analyzeAmpOffsetMetadata
      - analyzeMatchedVisitCore
      - analyzeMatchedPreVisitCore
      - analyzeObjectTableCore
      - analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore
      - catalogMatchTract
      - makeMetricTableMatchedVisitCore
      - makeMetricTableObjectTableCore
      - makeMetricTableObjectTableCoreRefCatMatch

      - photometricCatalogMatch
      - photometricRefCatObjectTract
      - plotPropertyMapTract
      - refCatObjectTract
      - validateObjectTableCore
    description: |
      Core (most important), coadd-level plots/metrics from analysis_tools.

      Must be run after 'step3' (writeObjectTable). Cannot be run with any
      dataquery constraints if analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore is included.
