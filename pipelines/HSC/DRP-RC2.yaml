      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.

      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression if any later steps will also be run, because downstream steps
      require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch' constraints will always
      select partial visits that overlap that region.

    description: >
      Per-visit tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1'.

      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression. skyCorr and FGCM require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch'
      constraints will always select partial visits that overlap that region.

      This includes FGCM because it's configured here to run in "global" mode,
      which means one should not use 'tract' expression to constrain it, and if
      one _did_ run it with a tract constraint (which would be a common
      occurrence if it was included in any later step), it would be fed the
      wrong (partial-visit) inputs to its 'background' connection.

      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.

    description: >
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets.

      These should be run with explicit 'tract' constraints essentially all the
      time, because otherwise quanta will be created for jobs with only partial
      visit coverage.

      It is expected that many forcedPhotCcd quanta will "normally" fail when
      running this subset, but this isn't a problem right now because there are
      no tasks downstream of it.  If other tasks regularly fail or we add tasks
      downstream of forcedPhotCcd, these subsets or the tasks will need
      additional changes.

      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.
  step4:
    subset:
      - forcedPhotCcd

      - writeForcedSourceTable
    description: >
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2' and
      'step3' subsets

      These detector-level tasks should not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as
      part of the data ID expression if all reference catalogs or diffIm
      templates that cover these detector-level quanta are desired.
  step5:
    subset:
      - drpAssociation
      - drpDiaCalculation
      - forcedPhotCcdOnDiaObjects
      - forcedPhotDiffOnDiaObjects

    description: >
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4' subsets

      This step includes patch-level aggregation Tasks. These should be run
      with explicit 'tract' constraints in the data query, otherwise quanta
      will be created for jobs with only partial visit coverage.
      'consolidateForcedSourceTable' is a tract-level task that aggregates
      patches and should be rerun if any of the patches fail.
  step6:
    subset:
      - consolidateDiaSourceTable
    description: >
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4' subsets

      This step includes visit-level aggregation tasks. Running without tract
      or patch in the data query is recommended, otherwise the outputs of
      consolidateDiaSourceTable will not contain complete visits.

      This subset is separate from step4 to signal to operators to pause to
      assess unexpected image differencing failures before these aggregation
      steps. Otherwise, if run in the same quantum graph, aggregated data
      products (e.g. diaObjects) would not be created if one or more of the
      expected inputs is missing.
  step7:
    subset:
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
      - consolidateHealSparsePropertyMaps
    description: >
      Tasks that should be run as the final step that require global inputs,
      and can be run after the 'step3' subset.

      This step has global aggregation tasks to run over all visits, detectors,
      tracts, etc.  This step should be run only with the instrument constraint
      in the data query.
