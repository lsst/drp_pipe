      Visit-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: visit

      Tasks aggregate all detectors for a given visit and perform
      full focal plane background estimation.
  step2b:
    subset:
      - isolatedStarAssociation
      - analyzeMatchedPreVisitCore
      - gbdesAstrometricFit
    description: |
      Tract-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: tract

      GbdesAstrometricFit and isolatedStarAssociation both use PreSources,
      generated by consolidatePreSourceTable, for all visits that overlap a
      tract.
      gbdesAstrometricFit produces solutions per-tract, per-visit
      isolatedStarAssociation produces solutions per-tract.
  step2c:
    subset:
      - fgcmBuildFromIsolatedStars
      - fgcmFitCycle
      - fgcmOutputProducts

      Global-level tasks that must not be run with any data query constraints
      Can be run anytime after subset step2a.

      Allowed data query constraints: instrument

      Tasks generate one data product per collection.
      FGCM performs better the more visits are included and
      make[Ccd]VisitTable produces per-collection summary of the Visits
      and CcdVisits.
  step2d:
    subset:
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - transformSourceTable
      - consolidateSourceTable
      - updateVisitSummary
      - reprocessVisitImage
    description: |
      Visit-level tasks.
      Allowed data query constraints: visit

      transformSourceTable and reprocessVisitImage run per-detector.
      consolidateSourceTable produces one data product per visit.
      finalizeCharacterization will eventually model full focal plane PSFs.
  step2e:
    subset:
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable

      Global-level tasks that must not be run with any data query constraints
      Can be run anytime after subset step2d.

      Allowed data query constraints: instrument

      Tasks generate one data product per collection.
      make[Ccd]VisitTable produces per-collection summary of the Visits
      and CcdVisits.
  # step3 is imported.
  # step4 is imported, but most tasks are dropped because the 'dia' subset is
  # excluded.
  step7:
    subset:
      - consolidateHealSparsePropertyMaps
      - analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore
    description: |
      Tasks that should be run as the final step that require global inputs,
      and can be run after the 'step3' subset.

      This step has global aggregation tasks to run over all visits, detectors,
      tracts, etc.  This step should be run only with the instrument constraint
      in the data query.
