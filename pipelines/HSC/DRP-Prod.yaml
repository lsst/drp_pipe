      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.

      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression if any later steps will also be run, because downstream steps
      require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch' constraints will always
      select partial visits that overlap that region.
  step2a:
    subset:
      - consolidatePreSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - skyCorr

      Visit-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: visit

      Tasks aggregate all detectors for a given visit and perform
      full focal plane background estimation.
  step2b:
    subset:
      - isolatedStarAssociation
      - gbdesAstrometricFit
    description: |
      Tract-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: tract

      GbdesAstrometricFit and isolatedStarAssociation both use PreSources,
      generated by consolidatePreSourceTable, for all visits that overlap a
      tract.
      gbdesAstrometricFit produces solutions per-tract, per-visit
      isolatedStarAssociation produces solutions per-tract.
  step2c:
    subset:
      - fgcmBuildFromIsolatedStars
      - fgcmFitCycle
      - fgcmOutputProducts
    description: |
      Global-level tasks that must not be run with any data query constraints
      Can be run anytime after subset step2a.

      Allowed data query constraints: instrument

      Tasks generate one data product per collection.
      FGCM performs better the more visits are included and
      make[Ccd]VisitTable produces per-collection summary of the Visits
      and CcdVisits.
  step2d:
    subset:
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - transformSourceTable
      - consolidateSourceTable
      - updateVisitSummary
      - reprocessVisitImage
    description: |
      Visit-level tasks.
      Allowed data query constraints: visit

      reprocessVisitImage, transformSourceTable run per-detector
      consolidateSourceTable produces one data product per visit.
      finalizeCharacterization will eventually model full focal plane PSFs.
  step2e:
    subset:
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
    description: |
      Global-level tasks that must not be run with any data query constraints
      Can be run anytime after subset step2d.

      Allowed data query constraints: instrument

      Tasks generate one data product per collection.
      make[Ccd]VisitTable produces per-collection summary of the Visits
      and CcdVisits.
  step3:
    subset:
      # per patch tasks
      - makeWarp
      - selectDeepCoaddVisits
      - assembleCoadd
      - detection
      - mergeDetections
      - deblend
      - measure
      - mergeMeasurements
      - forcedPhotCoadd
      - writeObjectTable
      - transformObjectTable
      # per tract tasks
      - consolidateObjectTable
      - healSparsePropertyMaps
      - analyzeObjectTableCore
      - catalogMatchTract
      - refCatObjectTract
      - validateObjectTableCore
      - analyzeMatchedVisitCore
      - photometricCatalogMatch
      - photometricRefCatObjectTract
      - plotPropertyMapTract

      tract-level tasks.  Allowed data query constraints: tract

      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2a',
      'step2b', 'step2c', 'step2d' subsets.

      If you do not include tract in the data query, you will get tracts with
      partial coverage.
  step4:
    subset:
      - forcedPhotCcd
    description: |
      Detector-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: visit, detector

      These detector-level tasks should not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as
      part of the data ID expression if all reference catalogs for seeding
      forced photometry cover these detector-level quanta are desired.
  step7:
    subset:
      - consolidateHealSparsePropertyMaps
      - analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore
    description: |
      Tasks that should be run as the final step that require global inputs,
      and can be run after the 'step3' subset.

      This step has global aggregation tasks to run over all visits, detectors,
      tracts, etc.  This step should be run only with the instrument constraint
      in the data query.
