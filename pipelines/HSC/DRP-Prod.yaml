      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.

      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression if any later steps will also be run, because downstream steps
      require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch' constraints will always
      select partial visits that overlap that region.
  step2a:
    subset:
      - consolidatePreSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - skyCorr
    description: |
      Visit-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: visit

      Tasks aggregate all detectors for a given visit and perform
      full focal plane background estimation.
  step2b:
    subset:
      - isolatedStarAssociation
      - jointcal
    description: |
      Tract-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: tract

      Jointcal and isolatedStarAssociation both use PreSources, generated
      by consolidatePreSourceTable, for all visits that overlap a tract.
      jointcal produces solutions per-tract, per-visit
      isolatedStarAssociation produces solutions per-tract.
  step2c:
    subset:
      - fgcmBuildStarsTable
      - fgcmFitCycle
      - fgcmOutputProducts
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
    description: |
      Global-level tasks that must not be run with any data query constraints
      Can be run anytime after subset step2a.

      Allowed data query constraints: instrument

      Tasks generate one data product per collection.
      FGCM performs better the more visits are included and
      make[Ccd]VisitTable produces per-collection summary of the Visits
      and CcdVisits.
  step2d:
    subset:
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - writeRecalibratedSourceTable
      - transformSourceTable
      - consolidateSourceTable
    description: |
      Visit-level tasks.
      Allowed data query constraints: visit

      writeRecalibratedSourceTable, transformSourceTable run per-detector
      consolidateSourceTable produces one data product per visit.
      finalizeCharacterization will eventually model full focal plane PSFs.
  step3:
    subset:
      - makeWarp
      - assembleCoadd
      - detection
      - mergeDetections
      - deblend
      - measure
      - mergeMeasurements
      - forcedPhotCoadd
      - writeObjectTable
      - transformObjectTable
      - consolidateObjectTable
      - healSparsePropertyMaps
    description: |
      tract-level tasks.  Allowed data query constraints: tract

      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2a',
      'step2b', 'step2c', 'step2d' subsets.

      If you do not include tract in the data query, you will get tracts with
      partial coverage.
  step4:
    subset:
      - forcedPhotCcd
    description: |
      Detector-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: visit, detector

      These detector-level tasks should not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as
      part of the data ID expression if all reference catalogs for seeding
      forced photometry cover these detector-level quanta are desired.
  step5:
    subset:
      - drpAssociation
      - drpDiaCalculation
      - forcedPhotCcdOnDiaObjects
      - forcedPhotDiffOnDiaObjects
      - transformForcedSourceTable
      - consolidateForcedSourceTable
      - consolidateAssocDiaSourceTable
      - consolidateFullDiaObjectTable
      - writeForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
      - transformForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
      - consolidateForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4' subsets

      This step includes patch-level aggregation Tasks. These should be run
      with explicit 'tract' constraints in the data query, otherwise quanta
      will be created for jobs with only partial visit coverage.
      'consolidateForcedSourceTable' is a tract-level task that aggregates
      patches and should be rerun if any of the patches fail.
  step6:
    subset:
      - consolidateDiaSourceTable
      - consolidateSourceTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4', 'step5' subsets

      This step includes visit-level aggregation tasks. Running without tract
      or patch in the data query is recommended, otherwise the outputs of
      consolidateDiaSourceTable, and consolidateSourceTable
      will not contain complete visits.

      This subset is separate from step4 to signal to operators to pause to
      assess unexpected image differencing failures before these aggregation
      steps. Otherwise, if run in the same quantum graph, aggregated data
      products (e.g. diaObjects) would not be created if one or more of the
      expected inputs is missing.
  step7:
    subset:
      - consolidateHealSparsePropertyMaps
    description: |
      Tasks that should be run as the final step that require global inputs,
      and can be run after the 'step3' subset.

      This step has global aggregation tasks to run over all visits, detectors,
      tracts, etc.  This step should be run only with the instrument constraint
      in the data query.
