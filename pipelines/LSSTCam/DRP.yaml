      Visit-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: visit

      Tasks aggregate all detectors for a given visit and perform
      full focal plane background estimation.

      TODO: Evaluate SkyCorr after intial DRP
  step2b:
    subset:
      - analyzeMatchedPreVisitCore
      - isolatedStarAssociation
      - gbdesAstrometricFit
    description: |
      Tract-level tasks
      Allowed data query constraints: tract

      GbdesAstrometricFit and isolatedStarAssociation both use PreSources,
      generated by consolidatePreSourceTable, for all visits that overlap a
      tract.
      gbdesAstrometricFit produces solutions per-tract, per-visit
      isolatedStarAssociation produces solutions per-tract.
      TODO: Evaluate GBDES after first DRP
  step2d:
    subset:
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - transformSourceTable
      - consolidateSourceTable
      - updateVisitSummary
      - reprocessVisitImage
    description: |
      Visit-level tasks.
      Allowed data query constraints: visit

      reprocessVisitImage, transformSourceTable run per-detector.
      consolidateSourceTable produces one data product per visit.
      finalizeCharacterization will eventually model full focal plane PSFs.
  step2e:
    subset:
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
    description: |
      Global-level tasks that must not be run with any data query constraints
      Can be run anytime after subset step2d.

      Allowed data query constraints: instrument

      Tasks generate one data product per collection.
      make[Ccd]VisitTable produces per-collection summary of the Visits
      and CcdVisits.
