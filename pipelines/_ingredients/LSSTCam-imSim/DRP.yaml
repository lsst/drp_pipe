      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.

      These may or may not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data
      ID expression. This specific pipeline contains no tasks that require full
      visits. Running with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select
      partial visits that overlap that region.

      In data release processing, operators should stop to address unexpected
      failures before continuing on to step2.
  step2:
    subset:
      - consolidateSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - isolatedStarAssociation
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - makeCcdVisitTable
      - makeVisitTable
      - updateVisitSummary
      - catalogMatchVisit
      - astrometricRefCatSourceVisit
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1'.

      This is a mix of visit-level, tract-level, and collection-level tasks
      that must be run with a skymap data query constraint only (an instrument
      constraint is fine, but generally unneccessary).  For example, running
      with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select partial visits that
      overlap that region.  A skymap constraint is necessary to prevent
      isolatedStarAssociation from producing results for all skymaps in the
      data repository.

      Visit-level tasks include consolidateSourceTable, consolidateVisitSummary,
      finalizeCharacterization, updateVisitSummary.
      Tract-level tasks include: isolatedStarAssociation
      Full collection-level tasks include: makeCcdVisitTable, makeVisitTable
  step3:
    subset:
      # Per-patch tasks
      - makeWarp
      - selectDeepCoaddVisits
      - assembleCoadd
      - detection
      - mergeDetections
      - deblend
      - measure

    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets.

      These should be run with explicit 'tract' constraints essentially all the
      time, because otherwise quanta will be created for jobs with only partial
      visit coverage.

      It is expected that many forcedPhotCcd quanta will "normally" fail when
      running this subset, but this isn't a problem right now because there are
      no tasks downstream of it.  If other tasks regularly fail or we add tasks
      downstream of forcedPhotCcd, these subsets or the tasks will need
      additional changes.

      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.
  step4:
    subset:
      - reprocessVisitImage
      - forcedPhotCcd
      - forcedPhotDiffim
      - getTemplate
      - subtractImages
      - detectAndMeasureDiaSources
      - transformDiaSourceCat
      - writeForcedSourceTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2' and
      'step3' subsets

      These detector-level tasks should not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as
      part of the data ID expression if all reference catalogs or diffIm
      templates that cover these detector-level quanta are desired.
  step5:
    subset:
      - drpAssociation
      - drpDiaCalculation
      - forcedPhotCcdOnDiaObjects
      - forcedPhotDiffOnDiaObjects
      - transformForcedSourceTable
      - consolidateForcedSourceTable
      - consolidateAssocDiaSourceTable
      - consolidateFullDiaObjectTable
      - writeForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
      - transformForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
      - consolidateForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4' subsets

      This step includes patch-level aggregation Tasks. These should be run
      with explicit 'tract' constraints in the data query, otherwise quanta
      will be created for jobs with only partial visit coverage.
      'consolidateForcedSourceTable' is a tract-level task that aggregates
      patches and should be rerun if any of the patches fail.
  step6:
    subset:
      - consolidateDiaSourceTable
      - sourceObjectMatch
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4' subsets

      This step includes visit-level aggregation tasks. Running without tract
      or patch in the data query is recommended, otherwise the outputs of
      consolidateDiaSourceTable will not contain complete visits.

      This subset is separate from step4 to signal to operators to pause to
      assess unexpected image differencing failures before these aggregation
      steps. Otherwise, if run in the same quantum graph, aggregated data
      products (e.g. diaObjects) would not be created if one or more of the
      expected inputs is missing.
  step7:
    subset:
      - consolidateHealSparsePropertyMaps
      - analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore
    description: |
      Tasks that should be run as the final step that require global inputs,
      and can be run after the 'step3' subset.

      This step has global aggregation tasks to run over all visits, detectors,
      tracts, etc.  This step should be run only with the instrument constraint
      in the data query.
