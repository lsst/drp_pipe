      Set of visit-level faro metrics. These tasks run on single-frame products and
      require Calibrated Source Tables, which are available after
      consolidateSourceTable (step6) is run.
  faro_tract:
    subset:
      - TE1  # query out to Arun
      - TE2  # query out to Arun
    description: |
      Set of tract-level faro metrics to be run on coadd products. These use Object
      Tables which are available after consolidateObjectTable (step3) is run.

      These must have a band constraint in their data query to avoid generating
      quanta for bands that do not have columns in the object table, since
      using an object table dataset as input does not provide information to
      the middleware about which tasks went into making the object table.
