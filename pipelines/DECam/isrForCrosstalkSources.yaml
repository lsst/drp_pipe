  The DECam prerequisite task isrForCrosstalkSources.

  The isrForCrosstalkSources task generates crosstalk sources for
  ISR/inter-chip crosstalk by applying overscan correction on raw frames. A new
  dataset is written, which should be used as an input for further DECam data
  processing.

  This task is intended to be run once, prior to initial data processing.
