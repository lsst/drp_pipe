  The DRP pipeline specialized for the DECam instrument, developed against the
  Merian dataset.

  Prior to running subsets or tasks in this pipeline, the DECam prerequisite
  task isrForCrosstalkSources must be run. More information on that task can be
  found in the isrForCrosstalkSources.yaml pipeline file.

      # whenever anyone is prepared to check to see if they work. Note that is
