      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.
      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression if any later steps will also be run, because downstream steps
      require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch' constraints will always
      select partial visits that overlap that region (also noting that while
      this may be moot for a single-detector camera, we would still like to
      follow best practices envisioned for the full LSST survey).

  step2a:
    subset:
      - consolidatePreSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - isolatedStarAssociation
    description: |
      Global tasks: This is a mix of visit-level and tract-level tasks that
      must be run with a skymap data query constraint only (an instrument
      constraint is fine, but generally unnecessary). For example, running
      with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select partial visits that
      overlap that region. A skymap constraint is necessary to prevent
      isolatedStarAssociation from producing results for all skymaps in the
      data repository.

      Visit-level: consolidatePreSourceTable, consolidateVisitSummary
      Tract-level: isolatedStarAssociation

    description: |
      Per-visit and per-collection tasks that can be run together after step2a.
      This step should be run with an instrument and skymap data query
      constraint only.

      FGCM requires full visits and 'tract' and 'patch' constraints will
      always select partial visits that overlap that region.

      This includes FGCM because it's configured here to run in "global" mode,
      which means one should not use a 'tract' expression to constrain it, and
      if one _did_ run it with a tract constraint (which would be a common
      occurrence if it was included in any later step).

    subset:
      - makeDirectWarp
      - makePsfMatchedWarp

      Tract-level coaddition tasks.
      Allowed data query constraints: instrument, skymap, tract.
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets. A skymap constraint must always be provided. If you do not
      include tract in the data query, you will get tracts with only partial
      coverage.

      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality. It may be removed in the future.

  step3b:
    subset:
      - consolidateObjectTable
    description: |
      Tract-level tasks.
      Allowed data query constraints: skymap, tract.
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2', and
      'step3a' subsets (separation into step3a and step3b is necessary for now
      as otherwise failures in upstream tasks will cause these to fail. This
      is hoped to be a temporary limitation).

  step3c:
    subset:
      - healSparsePropertyMaps
      - analyzeObjectTableCore
      - analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore
      - catalogMatchTract
      - refCatObjectTract
      - photometricCatalogMatch
      - photometricRefCatObjectTract
      - validateObjectTableCore
      - analyzeMatchedVisitCore
      - analyzeAmpOffsetMetadata
    description: |
      Healsparse maps and "core" (most important), coadd-level plots/metrics
      from analysis_tools.

      Needs to be run after 'step3b'. Must be be run with only instrument and
      skymap dataquery constraints if analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore is included,
      and optionally with these if analyzeObjectTableSurveyCore is excluded.

  step4:
    subset:
      - reprocessVisitImage
      - forcedPhotCcd
      - forcedPhotDiffim
      - getTemplate
      - subtractImages
      - detectAndMeasureDiaSources
      - rbClassify
      - transformDiaSourceCat
      - writeForcedSourceTable
    description: |
      Tasks that be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2', and
      'step3' subsets.

      A skymap data query constraint is always required for this step.
      These detector-level tasks should not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as
      part of the data ID expression if all reference catalogs are desired,
      and to ensure that consolidateSourceTable contains complete visits.

  step5:
    subset:
      - drpAssociation
      - drpDiaCalculation
      - forcedPhotCcdOnDiaObjects
      - forcedPhotDiffOnDiaObjects
      - transformForcedSourceTable
      - consolidateForcedSourceTable
      - consolidateAssocDiaSourceTable
      - consolidateFullDiaObjectTable
      - writeForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
      - transformForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
      - consolidateForcedSourceOnDiaObjectTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', and 'step4' subsets.

      This step includes patch-level aggregation Tasks.
      'consolidateForcedSourceTable' is a tract-level task that aggregates
      patches and should be rerun if any of the patches fail.

  step6:
    subset:
      - consolidateDiaSourceTable
    description: |
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2',
      'step3', 'step4', and 'step5' subsets.

      This step includes visit-level aggregation tasks. Running without tract
      or patch in the data query is recommended, otherwise the outputs of
      consolidateDiaSourceTable will not contain complete visits.

      This subset is separate from step4 to signal to operators to pause to
      assess unexpected image differencing failures before these aggregation
      steps. Otherwise, if run in the same quantum graph, aggregated data
      products (e.g. diaObjects) would not be created if one or more of the
      expected inputs is missing.
