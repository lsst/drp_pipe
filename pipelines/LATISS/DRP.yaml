      Per-detector tasks that can be run together to start the DRP pipeline.
      These should never be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as part of the data ID
      expression if any later steps will also be run, because downstream steps
      require full visits and 'tract' and 'patch' constraints will always
      select partial visits that overlap that region (also noting that while
      this may be moot for a single-detector camera, we would still like to
      follow best practices envisioned for the full LSST survey).

  step2a:
    subset:
      - consolidatePreSourceTable
      - consolidateVisitSummary
      - isolatedStarAssociation
    description: |
      Global tasks: This is a mix of visit-level and tract-level tasks that
      must be run with a skymap data query constraint only (an instrument
      constraint is fine, but generally unnecessary). For example, running
      with 'tract' (and 'patch') constraints will select partial visits that
      overlap that region.  A skymap constraint is necessary to prevent
      isolatedStarAssociation from producing results for all skymaps in the
      data repository.

      Visit-level: consolidatePreSourceTable, consolidateVisitSummary
      Tract-level: isolatedStarAssociation

  step2bcde:
    subset:
      - finalizeCharacterization
      - fgcmBuildFromIsolatedStars
      - fgcmFitCycle
      - fgcmOutputProducts
      - updateVisitSummary

    description: |
      Per-visit and per-collection tasks that can be run together after step2a
      with no data query constraints other than instrument.

      FGCM requires full visits and 'tract' and 'patch' constraints will
      always select partial visits that overlap that region.

      This includes FGCM because it's configured here to run in "global" mode,
      which means one should not use a 'tract' expression to constrain it, and
      if one _did_ run it with a tract constraint (which would be a common
      occurrence if it was included in any later step).

  step3a:
    subset:
      - makeWarp
      - assembleCoadd
      - detection
      - mergeDetections
      - deblend
      - measure
      - mergeMeasurements
      - forcedPhotCoadd
      - writeObjectTable
      - transformObjectTable
    description: |
      Tract-level coaddition tasks.  Allowed data query constraints: tract
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1' and 'step2'
      subsets.  If you do not include tract in the data query, you will get
      tracts with only partial coverage.

      This subset is considered a workaround for missing middleware and task
      functionality.  It may be removed in the future.

  step3b:
    subset:
      - consolidateObjectTable
    description: |
      Tract-level tasks.  Allowed data query constraints: tract
      Tasks that can be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2', and
      'step3a' subsets (seperation into step3a and step3b is necessary for now
      as otherwise failues in upstream tasks will cause these to fail.  This is
      hoped to be a temporary limitation).

  step4:
    subset:
      - writeRecalibratedSourceTable
      - transformSourceTable
      - consolidateSourceTable
    description: |
      Tasks that be run together, but only after the 'step1', 'step2', and
      'step3' subsets.

      These detector-level tasks should not be run with 'tract' or 'patch' as
      part of the data ID expression if all reference catalogs are desired,
      and to ensure that consolidateSourceTable contains complete visits.
