  The base tasks and subsets of DRP pipeline specialized for the ci_hsc test,
  dataset.

  This "ingredients" pipeline should generally be the one modified when new
  tasks are added/removed or configurations are changed, instead of its
  counterpart in the "pipelines" directory (though ingredients/DRP-Base.yaml is
  even better to modify, when appropriate).  The "pipelines" counterpart is
  the one that should generally be run, however.

  For historical reasons this file includes metric-measurement tasks from
  faro, but other analysis tasks should generally be defined in other files and
  imported into the runnable pipeline in the "pipelines" directory.
