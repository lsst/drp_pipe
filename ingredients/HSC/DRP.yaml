      Set of tasks for calculation of metrics via faro.
      These tasks are a mix of visit- and tract-level and must be run globally
      for RC2.
      Tasks that require single-frame products use Calibrated Source Tables,
      which are available after consolidateSourceTable (step6) is run.
      Tasks that require coadd products use Object Tables which are available
      after consolidateObjectTable (step3) is run.
