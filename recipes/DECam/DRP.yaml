# This DRP pipeline uses an obs_decam specific ISR configuration that
# requires crosstalk sources to be pre-generated via the
# RunIsrForCrosstalkSources.yaml pipeline.  This applies overscan
# correction and writes a new dataset that is then used as needed for
# the inter-chip crosstalk solutions.  Unless a specific overscan
# change is required, it may be best to generate these crosstalk
# sources soon after ingest to allow them to be readily available.
