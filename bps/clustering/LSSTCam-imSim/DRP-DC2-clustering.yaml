#
# For DC2 campaigns, the visit_detector (step1) clustering is modified since
# astrometric and photometric calibration are skipped in DC2
# this file swaps out two pipetasks: writePreSourceTable and
# transformPreSourceTable and replaces them with
# writeSourceTable and transformSourceTable
# for step1 clustering.
#
# Use it by adding:
#
#   includeConfigs:
#     - ${DRP_PIPE_DIR}/bps/clustering/LSSTCam-imSim/DRP-DC2-clustering.yaml
#
# (with no outer indentation) to your BPS config file.
