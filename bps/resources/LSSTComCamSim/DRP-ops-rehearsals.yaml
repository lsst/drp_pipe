# This BPS configuration snippet adds requestMemory values for all DRP
# and tasks for which the 99th percentile in memory usage exceeds 2GB from
# the Cumulative DRP produced for Ops Rehearsal 3
#
# Use it by adding:
#
#   includeConfigs:
#     - ${DRP_PIPE_DIR}/bps/resources/LSSTComCamSim/DRP-ops-rehearsals.yaml
#
# (with no outer indentation) to your BPS config file.
#
# NOTE: These numbers are from a campaign was run with clustering,
# which means that the values are per cluster NOT per task.
# Interpret these with caution, until we have a
# a run done without clustering to pull from.
